# GitHubExplorer
Test project to explore GitHub users



Create an ASP.Net MVC website with a page containing a text box to enter a name in and a submit button to search GitHub for the name.
Have the back end call the GitHub users API (e.g. https://api.github.com/users/robconery) and get the user name, location and avatar url from the returned json. Use the repos_url value to get a list of all the repos for the user.
On the results page, show the username, location, avatar and the 5 repos with the highest stargazer count. 
Use this opportunity to show us what you know, even if you wouldn’t ordinarily use the concepts in such a trivial example.
Upload your work to GitHub and send us the url of the repository. If you don’t have a GitHub account you can register for a free one at https://github.com/join. Please make sure that your repository is a public one.
